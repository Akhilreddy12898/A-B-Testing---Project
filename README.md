# A/B testing: A step-by-step guide in Python This is a walkthrough of how to design and analyse an A/B test using Python.

## Business Case
Letâ€™s imagine you work on the product team at a medium-sized online e-commerce business. The UX designer worked really hard on a new version of the product page, with the hope that it will lead to a higher conversion rate. The product manager (PM) told you that the current conversion rate is about 13% on average throughout the year, and that the team would be happy with an increase of 2%, meaning that the new design will be considered a success if it raises the conversion rate to 15%.

## Objective
Implemented an A/B testing initiative to evaluate the impact of a redesigned product page on the conversion rate for a medium-sized online e-commerce business. With an aim to increase the average conversion rate from 13% to at least 15%, the test involved a controlled experiment on a subset of users, providing a data-driven assessment of the new design's efficacy prior to a full-scale implementation.

## Steps
Designing our experiment
Collecting and preparing the data
Visualising the results
Testing the hypothesis
Drawing conclusions
